<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello! My name is Mark and I am an aspiring web developer. I was born and raised in Northern California among 3 other siblings.
<br />
Some of my hobbies include playing video games (mostly RPGs), watching sports (mainly football and basketball. Go Eagles and Kings!), making memes, and most recently, playing Magic the Gathering.
